# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

### The goal of this analysis is to use a neural network to determine which companies should be financed by Alphabet Soup. This analysis uses Python's TensorFlow library to build, train, and evaluate data collected from previous borrowings. With some knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, Beks created a binary classifier that could use features from the provided dataset to predict whether an applicant would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
